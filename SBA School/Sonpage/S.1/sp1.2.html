    The dominant styles of Japanese professional wrestling were set in place by the two dominant promotions in Japan. 
  New Japan Pro-Wrestling, headed by Antonio Inoki, used Inoki's "strong style" approach of wrestling as a simulated combat sport. 
  Wrestlers incorporated kicks and strikes from martial arts disciplines, and a strong emphasis was placed on submission wrestling. 
  All Japan Pro Wrestling, under the direction of Shohei Baba, used a style referred to as "King's Road". The "King's Road" style was 
  in large part derived from American wrestling, particularly the style of top wrestlers in the National Wrestling Alliance, such as 
  Dory Funk,Jr.Terry Funk, and Harley Race, all of whom wrestled for Baba in Japan. As such, "King's Road" placed a heavy emphasis 
  on working of holds, brawling, and the storytelling elements of professional wrestling. Throughout the 1990s, three individual
  styles — shoot style, lucha libre, and hardcore — were the main divisions of independent promotions, but as a result of the 
  "borderless" trend of the first decade of the 21st century to have interpromotional matches, the line between rules among 
  major-league promotions and independents has for the most part been blurred to standardization.

    Wrestling in America blossomed in popularity after the 1861–1865 Civil War, with catch wrestling eventually becoming the most 
  popular style. At first, professional wrestlers were genuine competitive athletes, but they struggled to draw audiences because 
  Americans didn't find real wrestling to be very entertaining, so the wrestlers quietly began faking their matches so that they could
  give their audiences a satisfying spectacle. Fixing matches was also convenient for scheduling. A real ("shoot") match could sometimes 
  last hours, whereas a fixed ("worked") match can be made short, which was convenient for wrestlers on tour who needed to keep 
  appointments or who needed to share venues. It also suited wrestlers who were aging and therefore lacked the stamina for an hours-long 
  fight. Audiences also preferred short matches. Worked matches also carried less risk of injury, which meant shorter recovery.Altogether
  ,worked matchesproved more profitable than shoots. By the end of the 19th century, nearly all professional wrestling matches were worked.

    In the early 20th century, professional wrestling was mostly a regional phenomenon in Mexico until Salvador Lutteroth founded the Empresa 
 Mexicana de Lucha Libre ("Mexican Wrestling Enterprise") in 1933, giving the sport a national foothold for the first time. The promotion 
 company flourished and quickly became the premier spot for wrestlers. As television surfaced as a viable entertainment medium during the 
 1950s, Lutteroth was then able to broadcast his wrestling across the nation, subsequently yielding a popularity explosion for the sport. 
 Moreover, it was the emergence of television that allowed Lutteroth to promote lucha libre's first breakout superstar into a national 
 pop-culture phenomenon.In 1942, lucha libre would be forever changed when a silver-masked wrestler, known simply as El Santo 
 ("The Saint"), first stepped into the ring. 
 Masks (mascaras) have been used dating back to the beginnings of lucha libre. Early masks were very simple with basic colors to distinguish 
 the wrestler. In modern lucha libre, masks are colorfully designed to evoke the images of animals, gods, ancient heroes, and other archetypes,
 whose identity the luchador takes on during a performance. Virtually all wrestlers in Mexico would start their careers wearing masks, but over 
 the span of their careers a large number of them would be unmasked. Sometimes, a wrestler slated for retirement would be unmasked in his 
 final bout or at the beginning of a final tour, signifying loss of identity as that character. Sometimes, losing the mask signifies the end of 
 a gimmick with the wrestler moving on to a new gimmick and mask. The mask is considered "sacred" to a degree, so much so that fully
 removing an opponent's mask during a match is grounds for disqualification.During their careers, masked luchadores would often be seen in 
 public wearing their masks and keeping up the k  ayfabe of lucha libre while other masked wrestlers would interact with the public and press 
 normally. However, they would still go to great lengths to conceal their true identities; in fact, the mask is synonymous with the luchador.
 Luchadors whose masks are removed or damaged in the ring would often allow themselves to be pinned in the scripted context of the match's 
 storyline,to preserve their identity. El Santo continued wearing his mask after retirement, revealed his face briefly only in old age, and 
 was buried wearing his silver mask. With the importance placed on masks in lucha libre, losing the mask to an opponent is seen as the 
 ultimate insult and can at times seriously hurt the career of the unmasking wrestler. Putting one's mask on the line against a hated opponent
 is a tradition in lucha libre as a means to settle a heated feud between two or more wrestlers. In these battles, called luchas de apuestas 
 ("matches with wagers"),the wrestlers "wager" either their mask or their hair. The first luchas  de apuestas match was presented on 
 July 14,1940 at Arena México. The defending champion Murciélago was so much lighter than his challenger Octavio that he requested a 
 further condition before he would sign the contract.Octavio would have to put his hair on the line. Octavio won the match and Murciélago
 unmasked, giving birth to tradition in lucha libre.
