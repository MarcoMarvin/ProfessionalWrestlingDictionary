    <FONT size="6"><U>Pinfall</u></FONT>
<FONT size="5">
  To score by pinfall, a wrestler must pin both his opponent's shoulders against the mat while the referee slaps the mat three times 
  (referred to as a "three count"). This is the most common form of defeat. The pinned wrestler must also be on his back and, if 
  they're lying on his stomach, it usually does not count.A count may be started at any time that a wrestler's shoulders are down 
  (both shoulders touching the mat), back-first and any part of the opponent's bodyis lying over the wrestler. This often results
  in pins that can easily be kicked out of, if the defensive wrestler is even slightly conscious. For example,an attacking wrestler 
  who is half-conscious may simply drape an arm over an opponent, or a cocky wrestler may place his foot gently on the opponent's 
  body, prompting a three-count from the referee.

  Illegal pinning methods include using the ropes for leverage and hooking the opponent's clothing, which are therefore popular
  cheating methods for heels,unless certain stipulations make such an advantage legal. Pins such as these are rarely seen by the 
  referee and are subsequently often used by heels and on occasion by cheating faces to win matches. Even if it is noticed, it is 
  rare for such an attempt to result in a disqualification (see below) and  instead it simply results in nullification of the
  pin attempt, so the heel wrestler rarely has anything to lose for trying it anyway.

    <FONT size="6"><U>Submission</u></FONT>

  To score by submission, the wrestler must make his opponent give up, usually, but not necessarily, by putting him in a 
  submission hold (e.g. figure four leg-lock, arm-lock, sleeper-hold).

  A wrestler may voluntarily submit by verbally informing the referee (usually used in moves such as the Mexican 
  Surfboard, where all four limbs are incapacitated, making tapping impossible). Also, since Ken Shamrock popularized it
  in 1997, a wrestler can indicate a voluntary submission by "tapping out",[69] that is, tapping a free hand against the 
  mat or against an opponent. Occasionally, a wrestler will reach for a rope (see rope breaks below), only to put his 
  hand back on the mat so he can crawl towards the rope some more; this is not a submission, and the referee decides what
  his intent is. Submission was initially a large factor in professional wrestling, but following the decline of the 
  submission-oriented catch-as-catch-can style from mainstream professional wrestling, the submission largely faded. 
  Despite this, some wrestlers, such as Chris Jericho, Ric Flair, Bret Hart, Kurt Angle, Ken Shamrock, Dean Malenko,
  Chris Benoit, and Tazz, became famous for winning matches via submission. A wrestler with a signature submission 
  technique is portrayed as better at applying the hold, making it more painful or more di  fficult to get out of than
  others who use it, or can be falsely credited as inventing the hold .

   <FONT size="6"><U>Knockout</u></FONT>

  Passing out in a submission hold constitutes a loss by technical knockout or technical submission. To determine if 
  a wrestler has passed out in WWE, the referee usually picks up and drops his hand. If it drops to the mat or floor
  one or three consecutive times without the wrestler having the strength to hold it up, the wrestler is considered 
  to have passed out.

   <FONT size="6"><U>Countout</u></FONT>
  A countout (alternatively "count-out" or "count out") happens when a wrestler is out of the ring long enough for 
  the referee to count to ten (twenty in some promotions) and thus disqualified. The count is broken and restarted 
  when a wrestler in the ring exits the ring. Playing into this, some wrestlers "milk" the count by sliding in the 
  ring and immediately sliding back out. As he was technically inside the ring for a split second before exiting 
  again, it is sufficient to restart the count. This is often referred to by commentators as "breaking the count".
  Heels often use this tactic in order to buy themselves more time to catch their breath, or to attempt to frustrate
  their babyface opponents.

  If all the active wrestlers in a match are down inside the ring at the same time, the referee begins a count (usually
  ten seconds, twenty in Japan). If nobody rises to their feet by the end of the count, the match is ruled a draw. Any
  participant who stands up in time ends the count for everyone else, while in a Last Man Standing match this form of a
  countout is the only way that the match can end, so the referee counts when one or more wrestlers are down and one 
  wrestler standing up before the 10-count does not stop the count for another wrestler who is still down.
